# Crazy-Pong-Game
Crazy Pong is a game created by putting a twist on the original game pong. It includes movement across the plane (horizontal and vertical movement) unlike regular pong where the paddles are set vertically. The idea for this game was born out of frustration with the slow pace of regular Pong, and the desire to create a faster-paced version.
