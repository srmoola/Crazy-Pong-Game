# Crazy-Pong-Game
Crazy Pong is a game created by putting a twist on the original game pong. It includes movement across the plane (horizontal and vertical movement) unlike regular pong where the paddles are set vertically. The idea for this game was born out of frustration with the slow pace of regular Pong, and the desire to create a faster-paced version.

## Features

* Horizontal and vertical movement of paddles
* Faster gameplay compared to regular Pong
* Two-player mode
* Interactive sound effects and graphics

## Installation

* Currently in the works

## Controls

* Player 1: Use the W, A, S, and D keys to move the paddle
* Player 2: Use the arrow keys to move the paddle
* Note: The ball only reflects when the paddle moves vertically. This allows you to move to other side of ball without pushing it forward
